# Jumper
Save your airborne friend by guessing the secret word letter by letter.
Don't mess up or he'll plummet faster down to the earth!

## Getting Started
---
Have Python 3.10 or newer. Navigate to the project root folder in a terminal
and run on of the following commands depending on your system:

	python3 jumper
	py jumper

You can also run the program by opening the game folder inside the root and
running __main__.py with an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- jumper                (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
